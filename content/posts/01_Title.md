## Introduction

Wildfire is the term used to describe an uncontrolled fire. If let lose these could potentially have devasting and life threating consequences of people, towns and environment effected by the fire. Besides the fire itself being dangerous it also heavily increases the air pollution[[1]](https://www.epa.gov/air-research/wildland-fire-research-health-effects-research) which could lead to long complications or even death[[2]](https://www.who.int/health-topics/wildfires#tab=tab_1). Burning of green areas also lead to increase of greenhouse grass emission which negativity impacts the climate and global warming[[2]](https://www.who.int/health-topics/wildfires#tab=tab_1).    

The importance of trying to predict and prevent wildfires is enough reason for us to try and investigate this event. By exploring a potential connection between poverty level and wildfires we would be able to see if there is a group of people in a bigger risk to the devastating consequences. This could also be used to argument for investing in fire safety in these areas if a correlation is found. 
A lot of different factors can play a role in why a wildfire is appearing in the US. These could either stem from natural casus or be a byproduct of human activities (either malicious or accidental).  To investigate this a database contains various information of wildfire in the timespan of 1992 â€“ 2015 [[3]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/code) will be used. Several visualizations will be created to get a better understanding of the information.

A dataset provided by OpenIntro [[4]](https://www.openintro.org/data/?data=county_complete) contains socioeconomic information will be used to investigate and answer the question of: **Is there a correlation between human created wildfire and poverty in the US?**
